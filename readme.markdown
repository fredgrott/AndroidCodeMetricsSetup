AndroidCodeMetricsSetup
=======================

Just a simple fast agile way to setup code metrics for an android project. We just use checkstyle, pmd, and classycle
and define the files for checkstyle and mpd that the IDE wil use. 

Just to see where Eclipse IDE puts stuff as far as checkstyle, classycle, and pmd. Each plugin likes to put reports 
in a different format or place.
